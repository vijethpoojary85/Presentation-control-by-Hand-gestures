# Presentation-control-by-Hand-gestures
Hand gestures are the most robust transmission mode for human-computer interaction. Generally, we use our keyboard, mouse, or any other input device to interact with the computer or application. In this project, we will use our hand gestures to give input to our program by using python libraries. When we make different hand gestures to the web camera, it will read the data from the image and analyse it to determine what kind of gesture our hand is making. Then it will process that data to perform a particular activity or give some output. The first step towards this process is capturing the hand gesture, then analysing it to get the data of the gesture and action mapped to gestures has to be performed. The webcam detection process is the first step because it detects your hands and serves as a medium for the computer and the human to interact by not using any words or an external input device. Using hand gestures as input will make it very easy to perform commands. Using it for a PowerPoint presentation will perform a specific task, such as scrolling forward or backwards or pointing to anything on the display interface, simply by using your hand and making gestures.
